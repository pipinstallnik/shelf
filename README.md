## Why I built shelf
I really like looking at other people's bookshelves when I go to their house. I know similar apps exist but I want to make something that looks really sleek and simple, that'd be shareable to social media, and make you want to look at the app and check your stats. I'm pulling a lot of visual inspiration from apps like Costar which makes what is essentially a cms/data query tool for astrology info but making it a really beautiful and enjoyable experience for the user.

## Feature request or idea?
You can reach out to nikolas.greenwald@gmail.com! This is a passion project but I'd love to hear what other people would like to see from an app like this.
